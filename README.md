# Cuba-React

Easily and seamlessly integrate react with your Cuba project.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cuba-react'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cuba-react

## Usage

From the shell, run:
  
    cuba-react generate

This will generate the following files in your project:

    views/layout.mote
    views/home.mote
    js/jquery.js
    js/react.rb

Include Cuba-react in your Cuba instance: 

    # app.rb:
    require 'cuba_react'
    Cuba.plugin CubaReact

...and route a url to 'home.mote':

    # app.rb:
    res.write view("home")

Finally, add the entry point and routing for sprockets to your config.ru:

    #Â config.ru:
    opal = Opal::Server.new {|s|
      s.append_path 'js'
      s.main = 'app'
    }

    map '/assets' do
      run opal.sprockets
    end

Congratulations - you just integrated React into your Cuba project!
